\section{Introduction}

Describe your research problem, 
including background, related work, etc. 

overview your proposed study, e.g. 
implement an algorithm and evaluate 
its performance; apply ML to a new 
application problem and evaluate its 
performance. 


\section{Methodology}

Describe the technique you are working 
with e.g., if you are implementing/developing 
an algorithm, explain that algorithm 
mathematically. 

\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Data Preparation}

Describe how you collected data, how 
you cleaned the data (if you did). 

\subsection{Experiment Design}

Describe how you design experiment, 
e.g., how to split training data and testing 
data; how to choose hyper-parameters; how 
to evaluate model performance (accuracy/f1/AUC).

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

Present your experimental results and discuss 
the results (e.g. what can we learn from the 
results?)
